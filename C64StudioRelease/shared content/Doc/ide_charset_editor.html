  <H3>Character Set Editor - Editor Pane</H3>
  <div id="mybody">
    The character set editor supports editing a set of up to 256 characters. Both single color and multi color are supported. Characters can be
    directly modified, flipped horizontally and vertically as well as copied and pasted to/from the clipboard.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Selection</b><br>
    You can select a single char by left clicking, a range by shift-left clicking or a rectangular selection by alt-left clicking. If copied and pasted from the clipboard the copied selection style will matter when inserting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Copy to Clipboard</b><br>
    The selected character is written to the clipboard as 8x8 sized 8 bit indexed image files where the first 16 colors are set in the palette.<br>
    Inside C64 Studio the actual selection is put on the clipboard.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Paste from Clipboard</b><br>
    A character is pasted from the clipboard, the image is expected to be 8 bit index and have a size of 8x8 pixel.<br>
    Pasting an image also will try to map to the currently set multi color colors. If the pasted image does not meet the expectations (eg. too many colors) the
    paste will be skipped.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Big Paste</b><br>
    Like wise any images from the clipboard are expected to be 8 bit indexed.<br>
    Pasting an image also will try to map to the currently set multi color colors. If the pasted image does not meet the expectations (eg. too many colors) the
    paste will be skipped.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Exchange colors</b><br>
    Pops up a menu where multicolors can be exchanged with each other or the background color. The exchange is done for the whole charset and also affects the multi color settings.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Force multicolor on paste</b><br>
    This setting affects pasting from clipboard. If checked and a pasted character looks the same as single and multi color (e.g. one of the multi color is blue) the preference is to use multi color.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Force Multicolor</b><br>
    Forces all characters to be flagged as multicolor.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Force Hires</b><br>
    Forces all characters to be flagged as single color.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Category</b><br>
    Displays/Sets the category of a character, useful for the category pane.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Show grid</b><br>
    Toggles a grid display on the character editor window.<br>
    <br>
