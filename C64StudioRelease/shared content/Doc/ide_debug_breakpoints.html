  <H3>Debug Breakpoints</H3>
  <div id="mybody">
    The "Debug Breakpoints" view allows to manage the current breakpoints. Breakpoints are memory locations where the emulator breaks into debugging mode if the location is either executed, read from or written to (depends on the creation flags).<br>
    Breakpoints can be added via this dialog or by clicking in the margin of the source editor.<br>
