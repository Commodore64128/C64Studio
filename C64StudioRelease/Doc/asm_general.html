  <H3>Assembler - General Syntax</H3>
  <H2>Syntax</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    C64Studio supports several different assembler syntaxes. Per default it uses its own syntax which is aligned with ACME.<br>
    A line of assembly in general uses one opcode. You can place several opcodes in one line, separated by colons.<br>
    Labels can be placed in front of an opcode, or stand alone on a single line.<br>
    Pseudo operators start with an exclamation mark.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Mnemonics are written as expected. For opcodes with literal values prefix # to the expression. Expressions are resolved in as many passes as required.
    If possible (e.g. the address is < 256) C64Studio tries to call the zero page variant of an opcode. If at the time of assembling the current line the value of address cannot be deduced, C64Studio will always play safe and use the 3 byte variant.
    You can force addressing behaviour by postfixing "+1" or "+2" to the opcode.<br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>        ;load the literal value $20 into the accumulator
        lda #$20

        ;uses the two or three byte opcode depending on the value of address
        lda ADDRESS

        ;force the zero page variant
        lda+1 ADDRESS

        ;force the three page variant
        lda+2 ADDRESS

  <H2>Labels</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    C64Studio supports four types of labels, global labels, local labels, cheap labels and immediate labels. The differences are mostly in regard to scopes or zones.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Global Labels</b><br>
    <br>
    Global labels start with letters. Their scope is global, e.g. they can be accessed by name from everywhere.<br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>  !zone Zone1
  GlobalLabel
        lda #15

        jmp GlobalLabel

  !zone Zone2
        jmp GlobalLabel
          <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Local Labels</b><br>
    <br>
    Local labels start with a dot. Their scope is local, e.g. they are valid inside their encompassing zone. If you want to refer to a local label from a differenz zone, prefix the zone name.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>  !zone Zone1
  .LocalLabel
        lda #15

        ;directly reference local label in same zone
        jmp .LocalLabel

  !zone Zone2
        ;allow the same label name in different zone
  .LocalLabel

        ;prefix parent zone name from other zone
        jmp Zone1.LocalLabel
          <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Cheap Labels</b><br>
    <br>
    Cheap labels start with a @. Their scope is global, and their name needs not to be unique. A new placement overrides any previously (upwards) existing definition.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>  !zone Zone1
  @CheapLabel
        lda #15

        ;directly reference cheap label
        jmp @CheapLabel

  !zone Zone2
        ;allow the same label name, overriding the existing label
  @CheapLabel

        ;you cannot reference @CheapLabel from Zone1 anymore
        jmp @CheapLabel
          <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Immediate Labels</b><br>
    <br>
    Immediate labels are consisting of + or - exclusively. A - means the assembler looks upwards for the first match, a + looking downwards. A new placement of the same label overrides any previously (upwards) existing definition.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>  !zone Zone1
  -
        lda #15
        bne ++

        ;directly reference cheap label
        jmp -
  ++
        rts

  !zone Zone2
        ;allow the same label name, overriding the existing label
  -

        ;jumps to the - just above
        jmp -
          <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <a name="align"></a>
  <H2>Literals</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    Literal values are either text or integer. Integer variables are either specified as decimal (default), hexadecimal (prefix $ or 0x), or binary (prefix %)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>      INTEGER
        !byte 17

      INTEGER2
        !byte $18

      INTEGER3
        !byte 0x18

      INTEGER4
        !byte %01001100

      TEXT
        !txt "I am a text",0
      <br></div>
