  <H3>Assembler - Pseudo Operations C64ASM</H3>
  <div id="mybody">
    C64Studio currently only implements a subset of pseudo operations of C64ASM. These pseudo ops are supported:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#text">.BYTE</a></li>
      <li><a href="#dataword">.WORD</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <a name="text">
  <H2>.BYTE</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    This pseudo op allows to insert text, characters, or one ore more bytes at the current location.<br>
    <br>
    Allowed are text literals, character literals, constant values, expressions and labels as content.<br>
    text literals are surrounded by ", character literals by '<br>
    Constant values can be set as decimal, hexadecimal (with prefixed $), chars (surrounded by ' or ").<br>
    Labels are treated as 16-bit values. To get the high or low byte prefix the label with &lt; (low byte) or &gt; (high byte)<br>
    Expressions are evaluated during the final pass. They must evaluate to a valid byte value.<br>
    CBM works like !TEXT, but reverses character casing.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>      .BYTE "HELLO WORLD"
      .BYTE " SCORE",60," 00000000   ",224,224,"         LEVEL",60," 00                    ",225,225,"         LIVES",60," 03 *"
      .BYTE 206,184,191,182,198,196,184,0,203,198,0,202,198,204,191,191,184,202,202,0,0
      <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <a name="dataword"></a>
  <H2>.WORD</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    This pseudo op allows to insert words (2 bytes) at the current location.<br>
    <br>
    Allowed are constant values, expressions and labels as content.<br>
    Constant values can be set as decimal, hexadecimal (with prefixed $).<br>
    Labels are treated as 16-bit values.<br>
    Expressions are evaluated during the final pass. They must evaluate to a valid word value.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>       ;inserts $80, $77
      .WORD  $7780
      <br></div>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
