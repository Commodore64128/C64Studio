  <H3>BASIC - Dialects</H3>
  <div id="mybody">
    There exist several BASIC dialects. BASIC V2 is hard wired, but any others can be configured externally.<br>
    <br>
    Laser BASIC and BASIC Lightning have been special cased as their parser seems to behave differently from the common parser.<br>
    <br>
    Adding new BASIC dialects with new token byte values (one or two bytes) is the expected process.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <H2>BASIC Dialect File</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    Several BASIC dialects come with C64Studio in the sub folder "BASIC Dialects". They are pretty self explanatory, a combination of text and CSV format file.<br>
    <br>
    C64Studio reads all dialect files on startup. If there are any format errors a message is added to the "Output" view.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Lines starting with # or empty lines are skipped.<br>
    A line "ExOpcodes" starts the extended opcode section. These are used for C64Studio internally.<br>
    All other lines are expected to contain three csv columns, separated by semicolon.<br>
    The first csv line is treated as header and also skipped.<br>
    <br>
    The three columns are "BASIC Token", "Byte Value(s)", and "BASIC Abbreviation".<br>
    <br>
    For example:<br>
    <br>
    <div id="code"><br>    NEXT;82;nE
    </div><br>
    NEXT is the regular BASIC command.<br>
    <br>
    82 is the hexadecimal representation of the byte value(s) to be inserted. C64Studio supports one byte, and two byte tokens.<br>
    <br>
    nE is the abbreviation. Normal token part is in lower case, any shifted letter is upper case. If there is no abbreviation for the token leave that column empty.<br>
    If an abreviation ends with an upper case letter typing that in the BASIC editor will automatically fill in the full command (e.g. "P-Shift-O" will turn to "POKE")<br>
