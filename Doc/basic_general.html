  <H3>BASIC</H3>
  <div id="mybody">
    C64Studio supports common BASIC V2 and several dialects. Other dialects can be added via external token configuration files.<br>
    <br>
    The editor provides a upper/lower case toggle, a symbol vs. macro mode and a label mode without actual line numbers.<br>
    <br>
    When writing in BASIC typing one apostrophe changes the entry mode, similar to the original BASIC editor. Key placement is now positional.
    Any control keys actually add their control character instead. Typing a second apostrophe or clicking on the "toggle entry mode" button in the toolbar stops the mode again.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    From left to right:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Label Mode</b><br>
    Toggles between line number and label mode. Note, this function does not do anything if the code won't compile properly.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Symbol Mode</b><br>
    Toggles between symbol mode and macro mode. In symbol mode any control characters inside strings are displays as on the C64.<br>
    In macro mode these symbols are replaced by macros surrounded by {, }.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Case/Lower Case toggle</b><br>
    Toggles characters between lower and upper case<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Toggle Quote Mode</b><br>
    Quote mode changes the key mapping between regular PC and a positional key map. This allows entering PETSCII characters the easier way.<br>
    In quote mode the Tab key is used as replacement for the Commodore Key.<br>
    Quote mode is automatically entered when an apostrophe is entered, and automatically ended when a second apostrophe is entered (just like the known BASIC editor)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Start Address</b><br>
    The address that is written in front of the compiled file as load address. Default is 2049 for the C64.<br>
    <br>
    Useful to change for other machines (VIC20), or BASIC programs, that are not to be placed at the standard load address.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>BASIC Version</b><br>
    Choose the BASIC dialect that should be used to compile. This mostly defines the values of the inserted tokens.<br>
    This list is populated by the files in the sub folder "BASIC Dialects".<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <H2>Renumber</H2>
  <div id="mybody">
    Choose renumber from either the BASIC menu, or via right click from the context menu.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/basic_renumber.png"><br>
    Renumber opens a dialog with some options<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If opened from the context menu the fields "first line number" and "last line number" are decided by the current selection.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Start with line number</b><br>
    The line number to start renumbering with<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Step by Line Count</b><br>
    Delta value to increase per line<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>First line number</b><br>
    First line number of line to renumber<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Last line number</b><br>
    Last line number of line to renumber<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Info box</b><br>
    Shows whether renumber will work, or if there are some problems with the given values<br>
